# JoeApl JS TS Premium Theme (free)

## Take a look

This theme has been created to make it easy to read and write using Javascript (react included), Typescript and added visual and understandable colors to HTML, CSS and JSON files.
To use this theme I recommend to install 'IBM Plex Sans' font (free), at the end there is a guide to install and
configurate. If you want to use ligatures you can also install 'Cascadia Code Font'.

## Install fonts and configure ligature (optional)
* Go to [IBM Plex Sans](https://github.com/IBM/plex/releases/tag/v6.1.1) for more legibility or to [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases) to have ligatures. Download and install the font/s
* Go to settings and search "font". If you choose to use 'Cascadia Code' keep the size in 14, if you are using 'IBM Plex Sans' change the size to 16.
